# Gossip-Website

This repository holds the contents of one of my first websites. I really enjoyed creating this website and learning to implement all the useful tools that can be added to a news
or gossip website. The contents of this repository include the images I used, the php, css and html code used in the process. This is one example of where my website development 
skills look like right now. There are many tools and instruments I would like to add on to this project in the future and I hope to return soon, in the meantime enjoy!
