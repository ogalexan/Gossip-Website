        <h2>Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn break up after 6 years</h2>
        <p>The one couple everyone (at least I) was rooting for has broken up. I wonder how Swift is holding up being that she is currently on her “Eras Tour.” They managed to keep their relationship mostly under wraps, but in true Taylor Swift style, she dropped some songs about him. Alwyn was also credited on a number of songs from Swift’s record breaking albums “folklore” and “evermore."</p>
